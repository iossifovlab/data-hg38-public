**Title**: De novo gene mutations highlight patterns of genetic and neural complexity in schizophrenia

**Abstract**: To evaluate evidence for de novo etiologies in schizophrenia, we sequenced at
high coverage the exomes of families recruited from two populations with
distinct demographic structures and history. We sequenced a total of 795 exomes
from 231 parent-proband trios enriched for sporadic schizophrenia cases, as
well as 34 unaffected trios. We observed in cases an excess of de novo
nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variants as well as a higher prevalence of
gene-disruptive de novo mutations relative to controls. We found four genes
(LAMA2, DPYD, TRRAP and VPS39) affected by recurrent de novo events within or
across the two populations, which is unlikely to have occurred by chance. We
show that de novo mutations affect genes with diverse functions and
developmental profiles, but we also find a substantial contribution of
mutations in genes with higher expression in early fetal life. Our results help
define the genomic and neural architecture of schizophrenia.

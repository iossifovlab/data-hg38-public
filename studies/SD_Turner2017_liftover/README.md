**Title**: Genomic Patterns of De Novo Mutation in Simplex Autism

**Abstract**: To further our understanding of the genetic etiology of autism, we generated
and analyzed genome sequence data from 516 idiopathic autism families (2,064
individuals). This resource includes >59 million single-nucleotide variants
(SNVs) and 9,212 private copy number variants (CNVs), of which 133,992 and 88
are de novo mutations (DNMs), respectively. We estimate a mutation rate of ∼1.5
× 10-8 SNVs per site per generation with a significantly higher mutation rate
in repetitive DNA. Comparing probands and unaffected siblings, we observe
several DNM trends. Probands carry more gene-disruptive CNVs and SNVs,
resulting in severe missense mutations and mapping to predicted fetal brain
promoters and embryonic stem cell enhancers. These differences become more
pronounced for autism genes (p = 1.8 × 10-3, OR = 2.2). Patients are more
likely to carry multiple coding and noncoding DNMs in different genes, which
are enriched for expression in striatal neurons (p = 3 × 10-3), suggesting a
path forward for genetically characterizing more complex cases of autism.

**Title**: De novo mutations in schizophrenia implicate synaptic networks

**Abstract**: Inherited alleles account for most of the genetic risk for schizophrenia.
However, new (de novo) mutations, in the form of large chromosomal copy number
changes, occur in a small fraction of cases and disproportionally disrupt genes
encoding postsynaptic proteins. Here we show that small de novo mutations,
affecting one or a few nucleotides, are overrepresented among glutamatergic
postsynaptic proteins comprising activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated
protein (ARC) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) complexes. Mutations
are additionally enriched in proteins that interact with these complexes to
modulate synaptic strength, namely proteins regulating actin filament dynamics
and those whose messenger RNAs are targets of fragile X mental retardation
protein (FMRP). Genes affected by mutations in schizophrenia overlap those
mutated in autism and intellectual disability, as do mutation-enriched synaptic
pathways. Aligning our findings with a parallel case-control study, we
demonstrate reproducible insights into aetiological mechanisms for
schizophrenia and reveal pathophysiology shared with other neurodevelopmental
disorders.

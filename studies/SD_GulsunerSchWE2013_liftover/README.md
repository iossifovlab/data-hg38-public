**Title**: Spatial and temporal mapping of de novo mutations in schizophrenia to a fetal prefrontal cortical network

**Abstract**: Genes disrupted in schizophrenia may be revealed by de novo mutations in
affected persons from otherwise healthy families. Furthermore, during normal
brain development, genes are expressed in patterns specific to developmental
stage and neuroanatomical structure. We identified de novo mutations in persons
with schizophrenia and then mapped the responsible genes onto transcriptome
profiles of normal human brain tissues from age 13 weeks gestation to
adulthood. In the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during fetal
development, genes harboring damaging de novo mutations in schizophrenia formed
a network significantly enriched for transcriptional coexpression and protein
interaction. The 50 genes in the network function in neuronal migration,
synaptic transmission, signaling, transcriptional regulation, and transport.
These results suggest that disruptions of fetal prefrontal cortical
neurogenesis are critical to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. These
results also support the feasibility of integrating genomic and transcriptome
analyses to map critical neurodevelopmental processes in time and space in the
brain.

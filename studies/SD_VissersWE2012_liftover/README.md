**Title**: Diagnostic exome sequencing in persons with severe intellectual disability

**Abstract**:

Background: The causes of intellectual disability remain largely unknown
because of extensive clinical and genetic heterogeneity.

Methods: We evaluated patients with intellectual disability to exclude known
causes of the disorder. We then sequenced the coding regions of more than
21,000 genes obtained from 100 patients with an IQ below 50 and their
unaffected parents. A data-analysis procedure was developed to identify and
classify de novo, autosomal recessive, and X-linked mutations. In addition, we
used high-throughput resequencing to confirm new candidate genes in 765 persons
with intellectual disability (a confirmation series). All mutations were
evaluated by molecular geneticists and clinicians in the context of the
patients' clinical presentation.

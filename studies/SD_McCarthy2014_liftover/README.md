**Title**: De novo mutations in schizophrenia implicate chromatin remodeling 
and support a genetic overlap with autism and intellectual disability

**Abstract**: Schizophrenia is a serious psychiatric disorder with a broadly undiscovered
genetic etiology. Recent studies of de novo mutations (DNMs) in schizophrenia
and autism have reinforced the hypothesis that rare genetic variation
contributes to risk. We carried out exome sequencing on 57 trios with sporadic
or familial schizophrenia. In sporadic trios, we observed a ~3.5-fold increase
in the proportion of nonsense DNMs (0.101 vs 0.031, empirical P=0.01,
Benjamini-Hochberg-corrected P=0.044). These mutations were significantly more
likely to occur in genes with highly ranked probabilities of haploinsufficiency
(P=0.0029, corrected P=0.006). DNMs of potential functional consequence were
also found to occur in genes predicted to be less tolerant to rare variation
(P=2.01 × 10(-)(5), corrected P=2.1 × 10(-)(3)). Genes with DNMs overlapped
with genes implicated in autism (for example, AUTS2, CHD8 and MECP2) and
intellectual disability (for example, HUWE1 and TRAPPC9), supporting a shared
genetic etiology between these disorders. Functionally CHD8, MECP2 and HUWE1
converge on epigenetic regulation of transcription suggesting that this may be
an important risk mechanism. Our results were consistent in an analysis of
additional exome-based sequencing studies of other neurodevelopmental
disorders. These findings suggest that perturbations in genes, which function
in the epigenetic regulation of brain development and cognition, could have a
central role in the susceptibility to, pathogenesis and treatment of mental
disorders.

**Title**: Meta-analysis of 2,104 trios provides support for 10 new genes for intellectual disability

**Abstract**: To identify candidate genes for intellectual disability, we performed a
meta-analysis on 2,637 de novo mutations, identified from the exomes of 2,104
patient-parent trios. Statistical analyses identified 10 new candidate ID
genes: DLG4, PPM1D, RAC1, SMAD6, SON, SOX5, SYNCRIP, TCF20, TLK2 and TRIP12.
In addition, we show that these genes are intolerant to nonsynonymous variation
and that mutations in these genes are associated with specific clinical ID
phenotypes.

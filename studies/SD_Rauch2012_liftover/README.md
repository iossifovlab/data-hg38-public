**Title**: Range of genetic mutations associated with severe non-syndromic 
sporadic intellectual disability: an exome sequencing study

**Abstract**:

Background: The genetic cause of intellectual disability in most patients is
unclear because of the absence of morphological clues, information about the
position of such genes, and suitable screening methods. Our aim was to identify
de-novo variants in individuals with sporadic non-syndromic intellectual
disability.

Methods: In this study, we enrolled children with intellectual disability and
their parents from ten centres in Germany and Switzerland. We compared exome
sequences between patients and their parents to identify de-novo variants.
20 children and their parents from the KORA Augsburg Diabetes Family Study were
investigated as controls.

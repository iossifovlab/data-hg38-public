**Title**: Prevalence and architecture of de novo mutations in developmental disorders

**Abstract**: The genomes of individuals with severe, undiagnosed developmental disorders are
enriched in damaging de novo mutations (DNMs) in developmentally important
genes. Here we have sequenced the exomes of 4,293 families containing
individuals with developmental disorders, and meta-analysed these data with
data from another 3,287 individuals with similar disorders. We show that the
most important factors influencing the diagnostic yield of DNMs are the sex of
the affected individual, the relatedness of their parents, whether close
relatives are affected and the parental ages. We identified 94 genes enriched
in damaging DNMs, including 14 that previously lacked compelling evidence of
involvement in developmental disorders. We have also characterized the
phenotypic diversity among these disorders. We estimate that 42% of our cohort
carry pathogenic DNMs in coding sequences; approximately half of these DNMs
disrupt gene function and the remainder result in altered protein function. We
estimate that developmental disorders caused by DNMs have an average prevalence
of 1 in 213 to 1 in 448 births, depending on parental age. Given current global
demographics, this equates to almost 400,000 children born per year.

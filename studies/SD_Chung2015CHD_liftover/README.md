**Title**: De novo mutations in congenital heart disease with neurodevelopmental and other congenital anomalies

**Abstract**: Congenital heart disease (CHD) patients have an increased prevalence of
extracardiac congenital anomalies (CAs) and risk of neurodevelopmental
disabilities (NDDs). Exome sequencing of 1213 CHD parent-offspring trios
identified an excess of protein-damaging de novo mutations, especially in genes
highly expressed in the developing heart and brain. These mutations accounted
for 20% of patients with CHD, NDD, and CA but only 2% of patients with isolated
CHD. Mutations altered genes involved in morphogenesis, chromatin modification,
and transcriptional regulation, including multiple mutations in RBFOX2, a
regulator of mRNA splicing. Genes mutated in other cohorts examined for NDD
were enriched in CHD cases, particularly those with coexisting NDD. These
findings reveal shared genetic contributions to CHD, NDD, and CA and provide
opportunities for improved prognostic assessment and early therapeutic
intervention in CHD patients.

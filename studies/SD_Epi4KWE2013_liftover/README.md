**Title**: De novo mutations in epileptic encephalopathies

**Abstract**: Epileptic encephalopathies are a devastating group of severe childhood epilepsy
disorders for which the cause is often unknown. Here we report a screen for de
novo mutations in patients with two classical epileptic encephalopathies:
infantile spasms (n = 149) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 115). We sequenced
the exomes of 264 probands, and their parents, and confirmed 329 de novo
mutations. A likelihood analysis showed a significant excess of de novo
mutations in the ∼4,000 genes that are the most intolerant to functional
genetic variation in the human population (P = 2.9 × 10(-3)). Among these are
GABRB3, with de novo mutations in four patients, and ALG13, with the same de
novo mutation in two patients; both genes show clear statistical evidence of
association with epileptic encephalopathy. Given the relevant site-specific
mutation rates, the probabilities of these outcomes occurring by chance are
P = 4.1 × 10(-10) and P = 7.8 × 10(-12), respectively. Other genes with de novo
mutations in this cohort include CACNA1A, CHD2, FLNA, GABRA1, GRIN1, GRIN2B,
HNRNPU, IQSEC2, MTOR and NEDD4L. Finally, we show that the de novo mutations
observed are enriched in specific gene sets including genes regulated by the
fragile X protein (P < 10(-8)), as has been reported previously for autism
spectrum disorders.

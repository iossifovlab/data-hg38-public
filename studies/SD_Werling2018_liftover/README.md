**Title**: An analytical framework for whole-genome sequence association 
studies and its implications for autism spectrum disorder

**Abstract**: Genomic association studies of common or rare protein-coding variation have
established robust statistical approaches to account for multiple testing. Here
we present a comparable framework to evaluate rare and de novo noncoding
single-nucleotide variants, insertion/deletions, and all classes of structural
variation from whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Integrating genomic annotations
at the level of nucleotides, genes, and regulatory regions, we define 51,801
annotation categories. Analyses of 519 autism spectrum disorder families did
not identify association with any categories after correction for 4,123
effective tests. Without appropriate correction, biologically plausible
associations are observed in both cases and controls. Despite excluding
previously identified gene-disrupting mutations, coding regions still exhibited
the strongest associations. Thus, in autism, the contribution of de novo
noncoding variation is probably modest in comparison to that of de novo coding
variants. Robust results from future WGS studies will require large cohorts and
comprehensive analytical strategies that consider the substantial
multiple-testing burden.

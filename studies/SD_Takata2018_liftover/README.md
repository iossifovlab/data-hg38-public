**Title**: Integrative Analyses of De Novo Mutations Provide Deeper Biological 
Insights into Autism Spectrum Disorder

**Abstract**: Recent studies have established important roles of de novo mutations (DNMs) in
autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Here, we analyze DNMs in 262 ASD probands of
Japanese origin and confirm the "de novo paradigm" of ASDs across ethnicities.
Based on this consistency, we combine the lists of damaging DNMs in our and
published ASD cohorts (total number of trios, 4,244) and perform integrative
bioinformatics analyses. Besides replicating the findings of previous studies,
our analyses highlight ATP-binding genes and fetal cerebellar/striatal
circuits. Analysis of individual genes identified 61 genes enriched for
damaging DNMs, including ten genes for which our dataset now contributes to
statistical significance. Screening of compounds altering the expression of
genes hit by damaging DNMs reveals a global downregulating effect of valproic
acid, a known risk factor for ASDs, whereas cardiac glycosides upregulate these
genes. Collectively, our integrative approach provides deeper biological and
potential medical insights into ASDs.

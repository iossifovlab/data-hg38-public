**Title**: 
Multiplex targeted sequencing identifies recurrently mutated genes in autism spectrum disorders

**Abstract**:
Exome sequencing studies of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have identified
many de novo mutations but few recurrently disrupted genes. We therefore
developed a modified molecular inversion probe method enabling ultra-low-cost
candidate gene resequencing in very large cohorts. To demonstrate the power of
this approach, we captured and sequenced 44 candidate genes in 2446 ASD
probands. We discovered 27 de novo events in 16 genes, 59% of which are
predicted to truncate proteins or disrupt splicing. We estimate that recurrent
disruptive mutations in six genes-CHD8, DYRK1A, GRIN2B, TBR1, PTEN, and
TBL1XR1-may contribute to 1% of sporadic ASDs. Our data support associations
between specific genes and reciprocal subphenotypes (CHD8-macrocephaly and
DYRK1A-microcephaly) and replicate the importance of a
Î²-catenin-chromatin-remodeling network to ASD etiology.

**Title:** Whole genome sequencing resource identifies 18 new candidate genes for autism spectrum disorder

**Abstract**: We are performing whole-genome sequencing of families with autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) to build a resource (MSSNG) for subcategorizing the phenotypes
and underlying genetic factors involved. Here we report sequencing of 5,205
samples from families with ASD, accompanied by clinical information, creating a
database accessible on a cloud platform and through a controlled-access
internet portal. We found an average of 73.8 de novo single nucleotide variants
and 12.6 de novo insertions and deletions or copy number variations per ASD
subject. We identified 18 new candidate ASD-risk genes and found that
participants bearing mutations in susceptibility genes had significantly lower
adaptive ability (P = 6 Ã— 10-4). In 294 of 2,620 (11.2%) of ASD cases,
a molecular basis could be determined and 7.2% of these carried copy number
variations and/or chromosomal abnormalities, emphasizing the importance of
detecting all forms of genetic variation as diagnostic and therapeutic targets
in ASD.

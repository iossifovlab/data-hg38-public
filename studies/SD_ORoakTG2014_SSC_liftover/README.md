**Title**: Recurrent de novo mutations implicate novel genes underlying simplex autism risk

**Abstract**: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a strong but complex genetic component. Here
we report on the resequencing of 64 candidate neurodevelopmental disorder risk
genes in 5,979 individuals: 3,486 probands and 2,493 unaffected siblings. We
find a strong burden of de novo point mutations for these genes and
specifically implicate nine genes. These include CHD2 and SYNGAP1, genes
previously reported in related disorders, and novel genes TRIP12 and PAX5. We
also show that mutation carriers generally have lower IQs and enrichment for
seizures. These data begin to distinguish genetically distinct subtypes of
autism important for aetiological classification and future therapeutics.
